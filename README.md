FishTank
============================

Stop coding and watch some fish!

### Installation
* Install [Package Control]("https://sublime.wbond.net/installation")
* Open the Command Palette (`ctrl+shift+p` on Windows, `super+shift+p` on Mac) * Type *Package Control: Install Package*; press enter
* Once the installation panel comes up, type *FishTank* and press enter to confirm.

### Usage
After installing the plugin, open the Command Palette and try out the commands that show up when you type "Fish Tank".

There are no key bindings installed by default, but there is an `Example.sublime-keymap` file if you want to add your own keybindings to your `User/Default (Windows).sublime-keymap` file (or Linux or Mac, obviously))

If you want, you can actually keep coding while your fish swim around! I don't know if I'd _recommend_ it, but it is possible. If you do, I'd recommend turning Word Wrap off and making sure you have `"trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": true` in your preferences. Also, remember to save your work after you finish with the fish!

###Disclaimer
I've only tested this on Windows; please create an [issue]("https://github.com/ahuff44/sublime-fish-tank/issues") on github and let me know if you find any bugs.
